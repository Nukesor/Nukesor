# Hello there, I'm Arne

I make things! Here're a few projects:

- üå† [`pueue`](https://github.com/Nukesor/pueue): A shell command scheduler.
- üî∂ [`comfy-table`](https://github.com/Nukesor/comfy-table) a rather popular CLI table library.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è infrastructure hosting for the [Tiefgang collective](https://github.com/Tiefgang).

I made things! Here're the most prominent discontinued projects (due to various reasons):

- ü§ñ [Ultimate poll bot](https://github.com/Nukesor/ultimate-poll-bot): A chat bot for all kinds of voting, polls and doodles with 2 million all-time users in the end.
- ü§ñ [Sticker Finder](https://github.com/Nukesor/sticker-finder): **The** solution to tag, manage and find your favorite stickers.

I also like good tooling! These are mostly built for myself:

- [`pueue-webhook-server`](https://github.com/Nukesor/pueue-webhook-server): A webhook server I use to deploy my own stuff.
- [`game-server-management`](https://github.com/Nukesor/game-server-management): Management binaries for a bunch of game servers.
- [`geil`](https://github.com/Nukesor/geil): A helper to manage too many git repositories.
- [`game-saver`](https://github.com/Nukesor/game-saver): Save scumming for games I'm too impatient for.
- [`hetznerbot`](https://github.com/Nukesor/hetznerbot): Sniping the best deals on Hetzner's server auction house.
- [`scripts`](https://github.com/Nukesor/scripts): My personal scripts.
