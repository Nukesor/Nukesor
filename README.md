# Hello there, I'm Arne

I make things! Here're a few projects:

- 🌠 [Pueue]: A shell command scheduler.
- 🔶 [Comfy-table]: a rather popular CLI table library.
- :shipit: [ALPM]: Arch Linux package management tooling (sponsored by [STF]).
- 🔭 [Berblom]: A novel Web-of-Trust algorithm to calculate trust for multiple anchors (sponsored by [STF]).
- ❤️ infrastructure hosting for the [Tiefgang collective].

I made things! Here're the most prominent discontinued projects (due to various reasons):

- 🤖 [Ultimate Poll Bot]: A chat bot for all kinds of voting, polls and doodles with 2 million all-time users in the end.
- 🤖 [Sticker Finder]: **The** solution to tag, manage and find your favorite stickers.

I also like good tooling! These are mostly built for myself:

- [`pueue-webhook-server`]: A webhook server I use to deploy my own stuff.
- [`game-server-management`]: Management binaries for a bunch of game servers.
- [`geil`]: A helper to manage too many git repositories.
- [`game-saver`]: Save scumming for games I'm too impatient for.
- [`hetznerbot`]: Sniping the best deals on Hetzner's server auction house.
- [`scripts`]: My personal scripts.
